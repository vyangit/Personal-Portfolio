# Personal-Portfolio

This portfolio landing page, with app catalogue, is an aggregated site for current and future projects I will work on and distribute. 

The portfolio is written in Typescript, and built with ReactJS functional components. The routing and outputted static site is generated with NextJS which is then statically hosted on Github pages.
